      <small><u>Also Known As:</u> Coreen Marie Kennard, Korrie Kennard, Korenna K Puleo, Korenna Barto, Dr. Korenna

  <div class="section warning">
    If you are thinking about hiring <a href="http://www.korennabarto.com">Korenna Barto Reynard</a> as a
    <b>therapist</b> or <b>counselor</b>, beware. This individual is a fraud. She has been practicing as an <u>unlicensed
    psychotherapist</u> and has harmed clients with unethical practices that include hands on "sexual healing" work.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Not a PhD or Licensed Professional</h2>
    <p>
      Despite her claims that she is a <b>psychotherapist</b> and <b>PhD</b>, this individual does not have an
      accredited PhD in
      Psychology or any other field and is <u>not licensed</u> to practice therapy or counseling in any state.</p>
    <p>She attended a PhD program at University of Akron over a decade ago but did not complete her degree. It also appears
      that there are complaints on file against her at her former University for her behavior after leaving the program.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Sexual Healing Work</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to falsely claiming to be a PhD, she has also promoted herself as <a
      href="http://podcasts.personallifemedia.com/guests/2977-dr-korenna-reynard">Dr Korenna Reynard</a>, claiming
      to be a <b>psychotherapist</b>, <b>somatic
      sexologist</b> and <b>erotic educator</b>. While offering these services, she practiced hands on "sexual
      healing" work with her clients and her prior website describes services such as <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121231120110/http://drreynard.com/female-ejaculation">Female
      Ejaculation</a>, <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130103161939/http://drreynard.com/men-masturbation-coach-advice">Masturbation
      Coaching for Men</a> and <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130126192323/http://drreynard.com/couple-erotic-coach-sex-advice/">Taoist
      Erotic Massage for Couples</a>.
    <p>In an interview with <a href="http://bliss-radio.com/masturbation/">Bliss Radio</a>, she discusses
      allowing a client to masturbate while in her office: <i>When I worked with that particular client, he would
        actually view porn while pleasuring himself in the office.</i></p>
    <p>It is unclear whether she is still offering these
      "services" to her clients as part of her current practice.</p>
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Questionable Past History</h2>
    <p>
      This individual has a checkered past and has undergone numerous legal name changes, the most recent less than 2
      years ago. This is most likely to protect herself from prior allegations of fraud or abuse.</p>
    <p>Known names she has used in the past in California, New Mexico, Ohio and Washington State include: Coreen Marie
      Kennard, Korrie Kennard, Korenna K Puleo, Korenna Barto PhD, and Dr. Korenna Reynard.
